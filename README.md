## Fraud Detection ML 

A work-in-progress project demonstrating my understanding and in machine learning workflows from data exploration to model analysis. 

This project will showcase my ability to:
- Explore and visualize data to identify trends and patterns  
- Preprocess datasets with techniques like OneHotEncoding and feature scaling  
- Build and fine-tune models using pipelines and search grids  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations  

Dummy dataset used for this repository can be found on Kaggle's [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).
